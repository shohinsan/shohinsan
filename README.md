## About Me 
Born and raised in Tajikistan, I moved to the United States in 2017 to pursue my dream of becoming a Software Engineer. I graduated from San Jose State University, majoring in Software Engineering. I am passionate about building software that makes a difference in people's lives.

When I am not coding, I enjoy playing soccer and hiking. Gaming is also another passion of mine, and I'm always looking for ways to add more excitement to my gaming experience or improve my skills. It's a fantastic way for me to unwind and have some fun.

- Languages: Java, Python, Go, TypeScript, JavaScript
- Frameworks: Spring Boot, FastAPI, SvelteKit, NextJS
- Software: RabbitMQ
- Tools: Docker, Kubernetes, Git, GitHub Actions, JUnit Testing, Leaflet, Kong API Gateway
